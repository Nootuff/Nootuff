## Hi! I'm Adam, 

I'm a Front-End Web Developer currently working for an award-winning ecommerce agency in London. I have 2 years of experience building user-friendly, cross-browser, SEO-optimized websites and working with HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, React, Node.js and RESTful APIs.

I love to code, encounter new challenges and build new solutions. I am dedicated to a lifetime of learning and improvement and I would love to connect with you.
